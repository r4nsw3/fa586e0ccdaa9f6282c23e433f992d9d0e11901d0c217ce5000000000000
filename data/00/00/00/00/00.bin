    Dragon Quest

    The peace of fair Alefgard has been shattered by the appearance of the
    nefarious master of the night known as the Dragonlord, and the Sphere
    of Light, which for so long kept the forces of darkness in check, has
    been stolen! It is time for you, a young warrior through whose veins
    flows the blood of the legendary hero Erdrick, to set out on a quest 
    to vanquish the Dragonlord, and save the land from darkness!
    Experience the first episode of the Dragon Quest series loved by 
    millions in Japan and worldwide! Created by a legendary trio with the
    master creator Yuji Horii, the revolutionary synthesizer score and 
    orchestration by Koichi Sugiyama, and art by master manga artist 
    Akira Toriyama.

    Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line

    A century has passed since the events of the first Dragon Quest, 
    during which time the descendants of the hero of Alefgard have forged
    three new nations. But the peace they have known is no more. Demon 
    hosts summoned forth from the darkness by High Priest Hargon have 
    rought the land to the brink of ruin once again. Now, the young 
    prince of Midenhall must set out to find the other two descendants
    of Erdrick so that together they might defeat the nefarious Hargon 
    and restore peace to their world.

    Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation

    On the morning of your sixteenth birthday, you are charged with a 
    seemingly impossible task by the King himself: to assume the mantle
    of your father Ortega, the hero of the land of Aliahan, and slay 
    the Archfiend Baramos, master of darkness! What trials await you,
    intrepid hero, as you set out on a quest not even your legendary 
    father was strong enough to complete?
